This tutorial will go through the main features of each, for full details see the documented source code.\n",

    "Before implementing a topic model, it is important to pre-process the data.  The first class in the topicmodels module is called RawDocs and facilitates this pre-processing.  We are going to pass this class the text data contained in the DataFrame along with a list of stopwords specified by \"long\".  Stopwords are common words in English that tend to appear in all text, and so are not helpful in describing content.  There is no definitive list of stopwords, and another option we describe below is to let the data itself reveal which words are useful for discriminating among documents.  The list of words comes from http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/english/stop.txt, but one need not use all of them.  In Hansen, McMahon, and Prat (2014), for example, we use just a subset of these, which you can use by specifying \"short\" instead of \"long\".  (You can view the stopwords by typing docsobj.stopwords into the interpreter)."

To illustrate, compare the fourth paragraph in the 1947 State of the Union Address as a raw document and after tokenization."

For implementing LDA, though, one generally wishes to focus on words.  docsobj has a method to clean tokens.  This will remove all non-alphanumeric tokens, and, by default, all numeric tokens as well (to keep numeric tokens, pass False as the second argument in parentheses).  The number passed as an argument removes all tokens whose length is less that - this can be useful if some symbols in the data like copyright signs trascribed as a single 'c' that the user would like to remove, in which case one would pass 1.  In this case, we pass 1 for illustration."

For example, the document above has the token \"obligations\" but another may have \"obligation\" and yet another \"oblige.\"  Ultimately these three words denote the same concept, and so we might want them to share the same symbol.  One way to achieve this is through stemming, a process whereby words are transformed through a deterministic algorithm to a base form.  One popular stemmer is the Porter stemmer, which docsobj applies (via its implementation in Python's Natural Language Toolkit).  This creates a new stems attribute."

We have already dropped standard stopwords, but there may also be data-dependent common words.  For example, in data from Supreme Court proceedings, \"justice\" might be treated as a stopword.  Also, words that appear just once or twice in the collection are not informative of content either.  Ideally, one would like a measure of informativeness that both punishes common words in the data, and rare words.  One such option is to give each stem a tf-idf (term frequency - inverse document frequency) score.  This is standard in the language processing literature, so we omit details here."

Stems with the highest scores include \"gun\", \"iraq\", and \"immigr\".\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the user can decide how many stems to drop based on either the df or tf-idf scores.  The first argument to rank_remove specifies the ranking method to use (\"df\" or \"tfidf\"), the second whether to drop from \"tokens\" or \"stems\" (since we formed the rankings based on stems above, we should specify stems), and finally the value to use for the cutoff for dropping stems.  One might instead prefer to provide a number $n$ such that all stems with a tf-idf value less than or equal to the $n$th ranked stem are then dropped, which we illustrate below.  One can determine the cutoff from exploring the csv files, but here we plot the ranking in Python, which indicates a reasonable cutoff is 5000.

The first is the number of iterations we want the chain to burn in before beginning to sample.  The second is a thinning interval, the number of iterations to let the chain run between samples.  Allowing for a thinning interval reduces autocorrelation between samples.  The third is the number of samples to take.  So, for example, if the user passes (1000,50,20) the following will happen.  First, the chain will run for 1,000 iterations.  Then 20 samples will be taken corresponding to the $\\{1050,1100\\ldots,1950,2000\\}$ iterations for a total of 2000 iterations overall.\n",

    "Because we allowed no burn in and started sampling straight away, one would imagine the initial draws were poor in terms of describing topics.  A formalization of this idea is to compute the perplexity of each of the samples.  Perplexity is a common goodness-of-fit meausure in natural language processing and information theory literature that describes how well a probability model explains data.  Lower values indicate better goodness-of-fit.  Calling ldaobj.perplexity() returns the perplexity of each sample."

In this case, one option is to $\\textit{query}$ those documents by holding fixed the topics estimated from LDA, and only estimating the distribution of topics for the out-of-sample documents.  The topicmodels module also provides a class for such querying, which this section introduces.\n",

In terms of estimating topics, the paragraph level is preferable to the speech level since individual paragraphs are more likely to be based around a single theme.  But, in terms of econometric work, the entire speech is a more natural unit of analysis.  At the same time, there is no general way of \"adding up\" probability distribution at the paragraph level in order to arrive at a speech-level distribution.  Hence the need for querying, which allows us to estimate the speech-level distributions.  (Extra credit: after the tutorial, estimate LDA on the entire speech level, and judge for yourself how the topics compare to those estimated at the paragraph level).\n",

    "Before continuing, suppose that we instead wanted to query a document whose constitutent parts had not been included in estimation, for example a State of the Union Address from the 1930s.  How to proceed?  First, create a RawDocs object with the text to be queried (recall that RawDocs can take a basic text file, which each new line treated as a separate documents).  Second, perform the same cleaning steps as were done for the documents that went into the estimated model.  However, there is no need to do any stopword removal.  When you initialize a Query object, tokens in the documents to be queried that are not present in the estimated model are automatically stripped out.\n",
